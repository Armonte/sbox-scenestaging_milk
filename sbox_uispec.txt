Localization

When displaying text such as Hello World, you should instead use a localization token like #menu.helloworld. This will automatically replace the text with the corresponding language set by the user when set on a Label, allowing you to easily support multiple languages.
Tokens

In UI, any displayed string that begins with a # will be recognized as a token, which means it will look for it's real value in the localization system.
Example

Filename: Localization/en/sandbox.json

{
  "menu.helloworld": "Hello World",
  "spawnmenu.props": "Models",
  "spawnmenu.tools": "Tools"
  "spawnmenu.cloud": "sbox.game",
}

Then it's as easy as doing the following:

<label>#spawnmenu.props</label>

HudPainter

Each camera has a HudPainter that can be used to draw onto the HUD. You do this every frame, in any Update function.

This is more efficient than using actual UI panels because there's no layout, stylesheets or interactivity.. you're doing all that stuff yourself.

If your UI is relatively simple, you can do it this way to keep things easy.

	protected override void OnUpdate()
	{
		if ( Scene.Camera is null )
			return;

		var hud = Scene.Camera.Hud;

		hud.DrawRect( new Rect( 300, 300, 10, 10 ), Color.White );

		hud.DrawLine( new Vector2( 100, 100 ), new Vector2( 200, 200 ), 10, Color.White );

		hud.DrawText( new TextRendering.Scope( "Hello!", Color.Red, 32 ), Screen.Width * 0.5f );
	}

Razor Components

Razor Component allow you to define some content to show inside another razor file. This makes it easy to create Panels that are more agile and reusable.
Creating a Razor Component

Here's an example called InfoCard.razor:

<root>
    <div class="header">@Header</div>
    <div class="body">@Body</div>
    <div class="footer">@Footer</div>
</root>

@code
{
    public RenderFragment Header { get; set; }
    public RenderFragment Body { get; set; }
    public RenderFragment Footer { get; set; }
}

Using a Razor Component

We can now very quickly and easily create Info Cards, and even add events/functions that interact with the parent Panel:

<root>
	<InfoCard>
        <Header>My Card</Header>
        <Body>
            <div class="title">This is my card</div>
        </Body>
        <Footer>
            <div class="button" onclick="@CloseCard">Close Card</div>
        </Footer>
    </InfoCard>
</root>

@code 
{
    void CloseCard()
    {
        Delete();
    }
}

Elements inside Panels

All Panels have a render fragment called ChildContent, so you can add elements inside of any Panel without adding your own fragments:

<InfoCard>
  <ChildContent>
    <label>Something inside of InfoCard</label>
  </ChildContent>
</InfoCard>

Razor Components With Arguments

RenderFragment<T> is used to define a fragment that takes an argument. Here's PlayerList.razor:

@using Sandbox;

<root>
    @foreach ( var player in PlayerList )
    {
        <div class="row">
            @PlayerRow( player )
        </div>
    }
</root>

@code
{
    public List<Player> PlayerList { get; set; }
    public RenderFragment<Player> PlayerRow { get; set; }
}

As you can see, we're now defining PlayerRow which takes an argument. To call it we just call it like a function, with the Player argument.

Now to use it we do this:

@using Sandbox;

<root>
    <PlayerList PlayerList=@MyPlayerList>
        <PlayerRow Context>
            @if (context is not Player player)
                return;

            <div class="row">@player.Name</div>
            <div class="row">@player.Health</div>
        </PlayerRow>
    </PlayerList>
</root>

@code 
{
    List<Player> MyPlayerList;
}

In the PlayerRow, we add the special attribute Context, which tells our code generator that this is going to need a special object context.

Then in the fragment, we can convert this object into our target type. Then you're free to use it as you wish.
Generics

You can make a generic Panel class by using @typeparam to define the name of the parameter

@typeparam T

<root>
    This is my class for @Value
</root>

@code
{
    public T Value { get; set; }
}

You will then be able to use this like a regular generics class in C#, like PanelName<string> ect.

In Razor, you will need to add a T attribute to define the type like so:

<root>
	<MyPanel T="string"></MyPanel>
</root>

Razor Panels

UI can also be created using Razor, which allows you to use web-like HTML/CSS to create and style each Panel while also being able to leverage C#.

The panels are created and rendered exactly the same way. They don't use a HTML renderer. This syntax is a convenience.
Creating a new PanelComponent

Every single UI consists of a PanelComponent at the root, with normal Panels being the children/content within. The PanelComponent can be added to any GameObject that also has either a ScreenPanel or WorldPanel component, and it will be drawn to whichever it has.

When you create a new Component, select "New Razor Panel Component" to get the following:

@using Sandbox;
@using Sandbox.UI;
@inherits PanelComponent

<root>
	<div class="title">@MyStringValue</div>
</root>

@code
{

	[Property, TextArea] public string MyStringValue { get; set; } = "Hello World!";

	/// <summary>
	/// the hash determines if the system should be rebuilt. If it changes, it will be rebuilt
	/// </summary>
	protected override int BuildHash() => System.HashCode.Combine( MyStringValue );
}

HTML/Razor

Anything within the <root> tags is treated as HTML, allowing you to inject C# as-needed, like so:

<root>
  @foreach(var player in Player.All)
  {
    <div class="player">
      <label>@player.Name</label>
      @if(player.IsDead)
      {
        <img src="ui/skull.png" />
      }
    </div>
  }
</root>

If no <root> element is present, then any and all elements will be a child of your Panel's root automatically.

You can also return early in Razor if you don't want it to render anything beyond the specified line.
BuildHash

A Panel's contents will only be rebuilt if the value returned from BuildHash() has changed from the previous value, so make sure to include certain values here to ensure the Panel updates when necessary.

A Panel's contents will also rebuild if if has pointer-events and the cursor enters/exits/clicks the Panel.

You can also force a rebuild by calling StateHasChanged(). This will queue the rebuild for the next frame.
Creating a new Panel

Since a PanelComponent is the root, any child elements are instead Panels. These are created in the exact same way PanelComponents are, but instead inheriting the Panel class (which .razor files do by default):

@using Sandbox;
@using Sandbox.UI;

<root>
  <div class="health">HP: @Health</div>
  <div class="armor">Armor: @Armor</div>
</root>

@code
{
  public int Health { get; set; } = 100;
  public int Armor { get; set; } = 100;
  
  protected override int BuildHash() => System.HashCode.Combine( Health, Armor );
}

How to Use

Back in your PanelComponent (or any other Panel), you can simply use the panel like any other element:

<MyChildPanel />

And can even pass variables to the Panel like so:

<MyChildPanel Health=@(30) Armor=@(75) />

How to store a Panel Reference

If you wish to store a reference to MyChildPanel so you can modify its properties in code, you can do this:

<root>
  <MyChildPanel @ref="PanelReference" />
</root>

@code
{
  MyChildPanel PanelReference { get; set; }
  
  protected override void OnStart()
  {
    PanelReference.Health = Player.Local.Health;
    PanelReference.Armor = Player.Local.Armor;
  }
}

Two Way Binds

Sometimes you want to bind a variable to a control, and if it changes, sync the value back. That's what this is.

You create a two way bind using :bind after the attribute name:

<SliderEntry min="0" max="100" step="1" Value:bind=@IntValue></SliderEntry>

@code
{
	public int IntValue{ get; set; } = 32;
}

The example above will update the Slider when IntValue changes, and IntValue when the Slider changes
Differences between Panel and PanelComponent

Since a Panel is not a Component, you cannot override OnStart, OnUpdate, ect.
Instead Panel has OnAfterTreeRender(bool firstTime) and Tick().

Since PanelComponent is not a Panel, you have to access it's Panel via the PanelComponent.Panel accessor.
This means where you can do Style.Left = Length.Auto on a Panel, you have to do
Panel.Style.Left = Length.Auto on a PanelComponent.

This also means you cannot do <MyPanelComponent /> within another Panel/PanelComponent, they must be added to a GameObject with a ScreenPanel or WorldPanel.





UI

Our UI system is structured around Panels. A Panel is a c# class that can have parent and child panels.

The panels use a stylesheet and flex system for layout and rendering.

They can be created directly in code or via Razor files with HTML/CSS syntax.
Making a C# Panel

Here's a basic example of a Panel that simply displays Time.Now:

public class MyPanel : Panel
{
  public Label MyLabel { get; set; }
  
  public MyPanel()
  {
    MyLabel = new Label();
    MyLabel.Parent = this;
  }
  
  public override void Tick()
  {
    MyLabel.Text = $"{Time.Now}";
  }
}

Using a Panel

Once you've create a Panel, it can be used in two different ways. The first is done identically to how we added a Label in the example above:

var myPanel = new MyPanel();
myPanel.Parent = this;

The other is by using the following syntax within a @Razor Panels file:

<MyPanel />

Creating a C# Root Panel

To draw your UI to either the Screen or to a World Panel, you'll need to create a PanelComponent. A PanelComponent acts as the root of all UI, and is added to any GameObject with either a ScreenPanel or WorldPanel component. Here's an example of how you can create a basic one including the above panel:

public sealed class MyRootPanel : PanelComponent
{
	MyPanel myPanel;
 
	protected override void OnTreeFirstBuilt()
	{
		base.OnTreeFirstBuilt();

		myPanel = new MyPanel();
		myPanel.Parent = Panel;
	}
}

Scaling

By default, ScreenPanels will rescale all UI based on a 1080p target height automatically. If you wish to disable this, or change the scaling to target the Desktop Resolution, you can change the following:

Styling Panels
Using Stylesheets

It is common to have a file system like this:

    Health.razor
    Health.razor.scss

If you do this, the scss file is automatically included by your Health.razor panel.

If you want to specify a different location for the loaded Stylesheet, you can add this to your Panel class:

[StyleSheet("main.scss")]

You can also import a stylesheet from within another stylesheet like so:

@import "buttons.scss";

Styling Directly

There are a few ways to style your Panels without a stylesheet. It's really recommended that you use a stylesheet to keep things organized, but there are also valid reasons to use the following methods.
Styling the Element

You can directly style any element just like you can in HTML, but can inject C# when necessary:

<label style="color: red">DANGER!</label>
<div class="progress-bar">
  <div class="fill" style="width: @(Progress * 100f)%"></div>
</div>

Style Block

Before or after your <root> element, you can add a <style> block that is read just like a Stylesheet:

<style>
  MyPanel {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
  .hp { color: red; }
  .armor { color: blue; }
</style>

Styling in Code

You can a Panel's Style directly and modify the values however you'd like via Tick() or OnUpdate():

myPanel.Style.Width = Length.Percent(Progress * 100f);

Custom Pseudo-Classes

These are some s&box-specific pseudo-classes which are useful for applying transitions when an element is created or deleted.

    :intro is removed when the element is created, things will transition away from this
    :outro is added when Panel.Delete() is called. The Panel waits for all transitions to finish before actually deleting itself.

MyPanel {
	transition: all 2s ease-out;
	transform: scale( 1 );

	// When the element is created make it expand from nothing.
	&:intro {
		transform: scale( 0 );
	}

	// When the element is deleted make it double in size before being deleted.
	&:outro {
		transform: scale( 2 );
	}
}
